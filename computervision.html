                        Computer Vision (CV) is the field of making computers
                        "see" the world as we do, by training a computer to understand 
                        digital images and videos. It is a sub field of Machine learning, 
                        which is itself a sub field of Artificial Intelligence.

                    <h2>So, how does a computer see?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Its harder than you think. Humans have evolved the way they see
                        and interpret the world through evolution over the span of human 
                        history. We are able to recognize objects, faces, and actions, without
                        much though about it.

                        To make a computer have "sight" it must first learn how to identify 
                        and classify objects. Machine Learning has made this process 
                        more accessible. Modern computer vision techniques have a 99% 
                        accuracy rate, making them more accurate than humans.

                    <h2>What makes it so hard to train a computer to see?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Well, to start, we don't fully understand how human sight 
                        works. We understand that the human brain abstracts what it sees
                        into categories and names those categories with labels.

                    <h2>What are the challenges?</h2>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        <strong>Object Classification:</strong> How can the object in the image be categorized?
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Identification:</strong> What type of object is located in the image?
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Verification:</strong> Is there an object in the image? Is that object part of one of the known categorizes?
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Detection:</strong> Where are the objects spacially located within the image?
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Landmark Detection:</strong> What are the defining characteristics of the object?
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Segmentation:</strong> What are the boundaries of the object? (e.g. the object outline)
                        <br />
                        <strong>Object Recognition:</strong> A combination of many of the previous challenges combined.
