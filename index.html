                    <p>AI, meaning Artificial Intelligence is the field of training 
                    computers to intelligently think like humans to perform tasks. 
                    The meaning of intelligent thought can be broken down into three categories;
                    Internal thought proccesses, reasoning, and behavior.

                    <br />
                    <p>Narrow AI is designed with a specific taks in mind to mimic human behavior.
                    Today, there are narrow AI's that touch almost everyones life. Often unknown 
                    to those that use them.</p>

                    <h3>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>General Intelligence AI's are defined by being able to do tasks on the same level
                    as humans.</p>

                    <h3>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>An Artificial Superintellegent AI is one that surpasses what humans are capable of doing.
                    With all the on-going advancements in AI, there are many warnings about the potential
                    harm that can come about. While the potential benefits are just as fascinating and 
                    in equal measure.</p>
